ABSTRACT:  
This project presents an interactive Sudoku solver implemented in C. The system allows users to fill empty cells in a Sudoku puzzle while validating each move according to Sudoku rules. The program tracks completion time and generates a personalized certificate upon successful completion. The project demonstrates algorithm design, input validation, matrix manipulation, and user interaction in C programming 
   
      
  
3.    Problem Definition   
Sudoku is a logic-based puzzle where a 9×9 grid must be filled with digits 1–9 such that: 
•	Each row contains all digits without repetition. 
•	Each column contains all digits without repetition. 
•	Each 3×3 sub-grid contains all digits without repetition. 
The problem is to design a program that: 
1.	Displays the puzzle clearly. 
2.	Accepts user moves. 
3.	Validates moves against Sudoku rules. 
4.	Tracks completion and time taken. 
5.	Provides a completion certificate.

       Flowchart 
┌───────────────┐ │ Start Program │ └───────┬───────┘ │ ┌───────▼────────┐ │ Print Puzzle │ └───────┬────────┘ │ 
┌─────────▼─────────┐ │ Puzzle Completed? │───Yes──► Print Certificate & End └─────────┬─────────┘ │ No 
┌───────▼────────┐ │ Get User Move │ └───────┬────────┘ │ ┌─────────▼─────────┐ │ Validate Move? │ └───────┬
───────────┘ │Yes ▼ Update Puzzle Grid │ └──► Loop Back  
 Algorithm 
1.	Initialize puzzle with predefined values. 
2.	Print puzzle using print_puzzle(). 
3.	Check completion using is_completed(). 
4.	Accept user input (row, column, value). 
5.	Validate move using valid_move(). 
o Check row, column, and 3×3 sub-grid. 
6.	If valid → update puzzle. 
7.	If invalid → reject move. 
8.	Repeat until puzzle is solved or user exits. 
Implementation Details 
Key Functions 
•	print_puzzle(): Displays puzzle with grid formatting. 
•	valid_move(): Ensures Sudoku rules are followed. 
•	is_completed(): Checks if all cells are filled. 
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
Algorithm for Main:   
   
1.	Input Player Details o Prompt user for Name, SAP ID, and College Name. 
o Store these values in variables. 
2.	Display Welcome Message o Print a welcome banner for the interactive Sudoku game. 
3.	Initialize Timer 
o	Record the start time using time(&start). 
4.	Game Loop (Repeat until exit or completion) o Step 4.1: Print the current Sudoku puzzle using print_puzzle(). 
o	Step 4.2: Check if puzzle is completed using is_completed(). 
	If completed: 
	Record end time. 
	Calculate time taken. 
	Print congratulations message and completion certificate. 
	Exit loop. 
o	Step 4.3: Prompt user for a move → (row, col, value) or -1 to exit. 
 If input is -1: 
1.	Print exit message. 
2.	Break loop. 
                        Step 4.4: Validate input range: 
1.	Row   [0,8], Col   [0,8], Value   [1,9]. 
2.	If invalid → print error and continue loop.                         Step 4.5: Check if cell is already filled: 
1. If filled → print error and continue loop. 
                        Step 4.6: Validate move using valid_move(): 
1.	If valid → place value in puzzle and print success message. 
2.	If invalid → print error message. 
5.	End Program 
• Return 0 to indicate successful execution.  
  
 
  
Algorithm for print_puzzle():  
   
1.	Print the top border of the Sudoku grid Output: +-------+-------+-------+ 
2.	Loop through each row (row = 0 to 8): 
o	If the row index is divisible by 3 (and not 0), 
print a horizontal separator line: 
|-------+-------+-------| o Start a new line for the row. 
3.	Loop through each column (col = 0 to 8): 
o	If the column index is divisible by 3, print a vertical separator "| ". o If the cell puzzle[row][col] is not zero: 
 Print the number followed by a space. 
o	Else (cell is empty): 
o	Print "." followed by a space. 
4.	End of row: 
o	Print closing "|" at the end of each row. 5. After all rows are printed: 
•	Print the bottom border of the Sudoku grid: +-------+-------+-------+ 
 
 
 
  
  
  
ALGORITHM FOR valid_move():   
   
•	puzzle[9][9] → the Sudoku grid 
•	row → row index of the move 
•	col → column index of the move 
•	val → value to be placed Steps: 
1.	Check Row Constraint o Loop through all columns in the given row. 
o If any cell in that row already contains val, return 0 (invalid move). 
2.	Check Column Constraint o Loop through all rows in the given column. 
o	If any cell in that column already contains val, return 0 (invalid move). 3. Identify 3×3 Sub-grid 
o	Compute starting indices of the sub-grid: 
	r = row - row % 3 
	c = col - col % 3 o This ensures we find the top-left corner of the 3×3 block containing (row, col). 
4.	Check Sub-grid Constraint o Loop through the 3×3 block starting at (r, c). 
o If any cell in this block already contains val, return 0 (invalid move). 
5.	If All Checks Pass • Return 1 (valid move). 
 
   
    
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
   
ALGORITHM FOR computer_move():  
  
Input: 
• puzzle[9][9] → the Sudoku grid Steps: 
1.	Loop through each row (i = 0 to 8): 
o	For each row, loop through each column (j = 0 to 8). 
2.	Check for empty cells: 
o	If puzzle[i][j] == 0 (meaning the cell is empty): 
o	Return 0 (puzzle is not completed). 
3.	If no empty cells are found: 
• After scanning all rows and columns, return 1 (puzzle is completed).
